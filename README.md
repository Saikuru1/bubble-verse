# The Bubble-Verse: A Decentralized Semantic Universe

> "A thought only exists as long as it is observed."

This is a peer-to-peer experiment in anonymous, long-form communication. There are no accounts, no servers, and no central authorities. The universe you see is generated in real-time by the collective minds of everyone currently inside it.

## 🌌 The Laws of Nature

### 1. Host or Die (The Law of Existence)
There is no central database. This universe is hosted on the browsers of its inhabitants. 
* If a thought is being read or searched for, the network "pins" it. 
* if a thought is forgotten and no one in the world is hosting it, it will physically dissipate from the Star Map. 
* **To save a thought is to value it.**

### 2. Semantic Gravity (The Law of Relation)
Your words have physical mass. 
* Thoughts do not live in "folders" or "subreddits." 
* They are pulled toward other thoughts that share their meaning. 
* If you write about *Philosophy*, you will find yourself drifting toward the *Socratic* galaxy.

### 3. Entropy (The Law of Expansion)
The universe is constantly expanding. New thoughts are born in the core, but over time, they drift toward the outer rim. Only the most "dense" clusters (highly discussed topics) can resist the pull of the void.

## 🚀 Navigation

### Desktop
* **WASD**: Fly through the void.
* **Mouse**: Look around.
* **Click a Bubble**: "Dive" into the paper.
* **Search Bar**: Warp to a specific concept.

### Mobile
* **Left Screen Drag**: Move.
* **Right Screen Drag**: Look.
* **Two-Finger Pinch**: Ascend/Descend.
* **Tap a Bubble**: Dive.

## 🛠 Technical Stack (Zero-Cost Infrastructure)
This project is designed to run forever with $0 upkeep:
* **Storage**: [IPFS (Helia)](https://ipfs.tech/) - Content-addressed peer-to-peer storage.
* **Database**: [GunDB](https://gun.eco/) - A decentralized graph for real-time coordinate syncing.
* **Engine**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - WebGL 3D rendering.
* **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (Static).
